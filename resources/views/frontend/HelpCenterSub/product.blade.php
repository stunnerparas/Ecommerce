                <li>Color Variances:
                    <p>We still make a special agreement to guarantee color uniqueness as soon as possible with our yarn suppliers. We recognize that there is no relationship between the two cashmere goats, so the reason is clear that the color varies slightly from the previous batch of yarn to the next one due to the use of different raw material in it. Although this is an unusual occurrence, it is possible to produce a new dye lot at each time. We also understand how essential it is for the color to be consistent from one product to another.</p>
