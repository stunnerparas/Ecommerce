                                <p class="text-justify">Organic cashmere is one among the purest, smoothest and most comfortable natural fibers in the world. This simple and elegant cashmere category is obtained by combining the goats rather than shearing them. The goats that are used for producing cashmere have 2-layer coats. Among the 2 layers, the undercoat is used for making the cashmere. The undercoat layer comprises soft and thin hair.

                                    This pure and pristine organic cashmere is used to make a variety of everyday products like sweaters, hats, thermal gear, blazers, scarves, shawls, poncho, gloves dresses and so on. The organic cashmere is pure and unbleached fiber. Cashmere is produced from goats. The breed of goat used to produce fine organic cashmere is found in Mongolia, Northern India, Afghanistan, Southwest China, Tibet and Iran.</p>
                                <p class="text-justify">So, the question arises- why this fixed breed of goats?
                                    The nomadic goats mentioned in above regions are forced to develop soft, dense and fleecy fibers underneath their rough overcoat to protect themselves from the cold. When the weather warms up and temperature rises, the goats start to lose their coats. The fur producer then combs these goats and ships the raw materials which are slightly processed to produce organic cashmere.</p>

                            <p class="text-justify py-2">Cashmere and wool are 2 of the softest and smoothest fabric known today. However, there is a subtle difference between them. For starters, while organic cashmere is prepared from goats, wools are prepared from sheep. Organic cashmere is more expensive than wool when compared to wool.  In the positive light, the products and garments made from organic cashmere offer better insulation and are approximately 8 times warmer than the latter. Wool has other advantages over cashmere when it comes to elasticity and durability.</p>

                                <p class="text-justify py-2">One of the first things you can do to preserve your organic cashmere product is not wash it every time you wear. You can simply hang it and let it dry by just air. You can use baby shampoo to wash your cashmere since it is not much chemically processed and won’t harm the composition of your fabric. Even when you use baby shampoo, make sure that you don’t overdo it. Don’t iron the cashmere clothes directly. </p>
